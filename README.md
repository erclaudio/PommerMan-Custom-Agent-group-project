# PommerMan Custom Agent group project
Attempt at developing an A.I. agent for a real time imperfect game using the “Pommerman” framework, a Java implementation of the game “Bomber-Man”
# Abstract
Real-time imperfect information games pose a significant challenge for Artificially intelligent Agents. A real-time game forces an agent to decide an action within a specified budged (100ms typically), while imperfect information games hide information from the agent which makes it more difficult for an agent to decide an action. This report discusses the development of an artificially intelligent agent that can play a real-time imperfect information game named “Bomber-Man”. The report also includes a literature review that explores similar research in this area. Our agent is a hybrid agent that uses rule-based actions and a modified MCTS algorithm to decide what is the best action to do next. The performance of our proposed agent is compared against previously implemented agents (vanilla MCTS, REHA, OSLA, and rule based) in different settings (full observability, partial observability, free-for-all, teams, and 1-on-1). Results show that our agent surpasses other agents in most experiments.
