Steps to run the agent:

1\ Make sure that the Pommerman framework is working.

2\ move the file "PommermanCustomAgent" in the "src\players" directory.

3\ open the run.java class

4\ paste those two lines at the top: 

import players.PommermanCustomAgent.CustomMCTSParams;
import players.PommermanCustomAgent.CustomPlayer;

5\ in run.java class search for the switch statement that initializes the already implemented players.

6\ when you find it, copy and paste the code below after the last "case" in the code.

case 7 :

                        CustomMCTSParams param = new CustomMCTSParams();
                        param.stop_type = param.STOP_TIME;
                        p = new CustomPlayer(seed,playerID++,param);
                        playerStr[i-4] = "hybridAgent";
break;


ps: I choose the number 7 because its my luck number. if you change it our agent won't win the competition :).
